# allow-debug-now
Chrome extension to debug a web page, even when dev tries to forbid it

### Install

1. Download **extension** folder
2. Go to **chrome://extensions/** or **edge://extensions/**
3. Activate **developer mode**
4. Load **unpacked folder**

### Note
I'll see to provide a packaged version later.
Still way too early. Just playing.

### Warning
Don't forget to disable it when not required as it would probably destroy your experience on other websites.
